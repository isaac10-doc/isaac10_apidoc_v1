# Customer Registration

Customer registration is done in four steps:

1.  [Request the plan data](#request-plan-data) to receive all data that is
    needed to display the registration form.

2.  (optional) When the customer entered a coupon code, you may
    [check if the entered coupon code is valid](#check-coupon-code).

3.  [Register the customer](#register) the customer by submitting the entered
    data for the customer account, subscription, billing address and payment
    information.

4.  [Confirm the subscription](#confirm-subscription) of the customer. **This
    step is mandatory.** As long as a subscription is not confirmed, it will not
    show up in your subscription overview and will not be accessible.
