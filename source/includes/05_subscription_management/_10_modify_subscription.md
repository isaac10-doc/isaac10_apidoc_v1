## Modify Subscription

The modification of a subscription is identical to [Adding a Subscription](#adding-a-new-subscription). _isaac10_ verifies if a subscription for this product is already existing for the customer.

When upgrading, the plan modification becomes effective immediately whereas when downgrading the plan modification just starts at the end of the respective contract period.
