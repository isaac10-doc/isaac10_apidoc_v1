## Enabled billing intervals

_isaac10_ offers three billing intervals:

-   monthly
-   quarterly
-   yearly

Not all billing intervals are available at all times. A billing interval is _enabled_ when there is a price defined for that billing interval:

-   When [registering a new customer](#register), [adding a new subscription](#adding-a-new-subscription) or [upgrading/downgrading a subscription](#upgrading-downgrading-a-subscription), the billing interval must be enabled on the _plan_ that should be subscribed.
-   When [updating a subscription](#updating-a-subscription), the billing interval must be enabled on the _subscription_ you are about to update. There may be billing intervals available for a specific subscription that are not available for it's plan and vice versa as you, as a merchant, can edit a subscription in you merchant backend and add or remove prices for the subscription. This alters the enabled billing intervals _for the subscription_ without altering the plan.
